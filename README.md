# WordleBot
Capable of solving popular Wordle puzzle, developed in 2022
# Files
The first five versions of this program work via command line using a very archaic interface I developed.  They improve on the solving algorithim and other minor changes between the versions.
The final sixth version of this program works with Selenium Web Automation to automate inputs of the words into the puzzle on the Wordle archives, which has since been deprecated.
All versions of the WordleBot utilize the same library of words as the Wordle game, which can be found in the data directory under the file wordleWords.txt
